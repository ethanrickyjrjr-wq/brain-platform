/**
 * lib/reconcile/types.ts — Plan C, lane-3 reconciliation contract.
 *
 * Lane 1 (our cited lake fact) vs lane 2 (the user's-AI assertion), compared by
 * the deterministic `reconcileMetric` comparator under a HARD self-TTL gate.
 * Every shape here is lane-tagged so a reader (and the fixtures) can never
 * confuse a synthetic input with a live one.
 *
 * Prime directive: the comparator NEVER asserts a stale or invented figure. A
 * lake fact past its `expires` is withheld (`cannot_assert_stale`); an assertion
 * finer than the lake grain is never fabricated (`out_of_grain`); a fact with no
 * TTL basis at all is `not_found`, never falsely "expired".
