## fgcu-reri

**confidence: 0.85**

- Rationale: FGCU RERI is a primary university source (Lutgert College of Business,
  peer-reviewed methodology). Single-source brain with no cross-validation upstream.
- Data lag: ~2 months structural (e.g., May 2026 report covers March 2026 data).
  Lag is baked into `caveats` on every build, not penalized in confidence.
- Benchmark: BLS LAUS (government primary, single-source) ships at 0.80–0.85 in macro-swfl.
  FGCU RERI is comparable provenance quality.

**fitScore: 0.7**

- Rationale: Dedicated SWFL regional macro leaf. Always relevant to SWFL macro queries.
  Not a universal macro brain (no national/state coverage) — capped below 1.0 to allow
  broader-scope brains to rank above it when the query is national or Florida-wide.
