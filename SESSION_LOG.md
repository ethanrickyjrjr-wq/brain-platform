## 2026-05-26 (Opus 4.7 · fix/firecrawl-agent-client) — firecrawl /v2/agent polling fix + spider fallback layer

- Root cause: `ingest/lib/firecrawl_client.py:agent()` was a single sync POST that returned the job-ID payload, never polled `GET /v2/agent/<id>`. Three pipelines (corridor_narratives, marketbeat_swfl, county_planning_swfl) were silently failing with "zero rows" because the extractor was reading `data.result.rows` on `{success, id}` — finds nothing → empty. Vendor-first verified `firecrawl-py>=4.28.0` already implements correct polling via `Firecrawl().agent()`.
- Wrapper fix: `agent()` now delegates to the SDK; raises `FirecrawlError` on terminal non-completed status (`failed` / `cancelled`) so silent-empty stops being a failure mode. `extract_agent_rows()` reads `data.rows` first; keeps legacy `data.result.rows` + `result.rows` as defensive fallbacks. 7 mocked tests cover happy + failed + legacy + empty + missing-key paths.
- Fallback layer (operator-requested, same PR): new `ingest/lib/spider_client.py` wraps `https://api.spider.cloud/ai/scrape` (defensive response parsing — OpenAPI spec underdocumented); new `ingest/lib/extract_client.py` `extract()` tries firecrawl across all URLs → on empty/error, per-URL spider fallback. Returns firecrawl-shape dict + `_provenance` log; raises `ExtractError` only when both vendors fail loudly per URL. 7 fallback tests green. 3 pipelines swapped to `extract()`; `SPIDER_API_KEY` wired to 3 GHA workflow env blocks + `ingest/.env.example`. Pipelines stay running on firecrawl-only when `SPIDER_API_KEY` unset.
- Why bundled: shared root cause (single client, three consumers); spider rescue is the durable answer to the silent-fail vendor lock-in.
- Discovery (use spider triage before next PR): all 4 corridor_narratives BROKER_SOURCES URLs are dead — `creconsultants.com/research/` 404, `lsicompanies.com/market-reports/` 404, `ipcswfl.com/research/` 525, `svnswfl.com/market-reports` 525. Wrapper fix surfaces this loudly now; URL audit is a separate follow-up PR per the corridor-broker-promotion plan Step 1.
- Followup commit on same branch: `spider_client.ai_scrape()` now sets `stealth=True` + `anti_bot=True` + `proxy_enabled=True` by default. Spider's `/unblocker` endpoint per OpenAPI only takes `RequestParams` (no `prompt`/`extraction_schema`), so chaining unblocker → re-extract would have been two round-trips; setting the same RequestParams flags on `/ai/scrape` does the unblock-then-extract in one call. This is the durable answer for the 525-blocked broker pages (`ipcswfl.com`, `svnswfl.com`).
- Next: live dry-runs (`gh workflow run corridor-narratives-quarterly.yml -f dry_run=true`, same for county-planning + marketbeat) to confirm spider rescue path lights up. Then URL audit follow-up.

## 2026-05-26 (Opus 4.7 · main) — corridor character generator Step 1 SHIPPED + tool-version correction

- Step 1 (Anthropic web_search verification + smoke against Pine Ridge Rd Naples) done. Vendor-first WebFetch confirmed contract; ran two questions through `web_search_20260209` then an A/B with `web_search_20250305` on Q1 after observing zero `cited_text` spans in the dynamic-filtering variant. Same prompt, same model, same `allowed_domains`: `20260209` returned 0 cited spans (Claude pipes content through code-execution and emits text from Python variables); `20250305` returned 9 verbatim cited spans with raw publisher URLs. **Corrected tool-version pick from `20260209` → `20250305`** in the v2 plan, the research doc (correction note at top), and memory. Anthropic-as-vendor unchanged.
- Other findings: `news-press.com` and `naplesnews.com` block Anthropic's crawler — API rejects allowlist with 400. Pine Ridge–specific NNN rents are not on the open web (paywalled in LoopNet/CoStar) — facts block will have to surface this as `{value: null, gap_reason: ...}` and let the speculative block do the inference work. Token budget for the full generator is ~$30/yr at `20250305`.
- Files: `docs/vendor-notes/anthropic-web-search-wire-up.md` (Step 1 deliverable — full Q&A, A/B table, blocked-publisher list, verified seed allowlist, parallel-eligible Step-2 task split for Opus + Sonnet), `docs/vendor-notes/anthropic-web-search-smoke-output.json` + `anthropic-web-search-compare-output.json` (raw API responses), `scripts/smoke/anthropic_web_search_smoke.py` + `anthropic_web_search_compare.py` (re-runnable). Plan + research doc + memory + this log carry the correction. `pip install anthropic` added a setup dep — flag for ingest pipeline `requirements.txt` work in Step 2 B1.
- Next: Step 2 (Pine Ridge end-to-end generator) — A1 Stage A fact pack builder + A2 SQL migration can run in parallel on Opus; B1 Stage B Python pipeline runs against the verified `20250305` contract on Sonnet; C1+C2 synthesis + lint stack are Opus-sequential after A+B contracts firm. Worktree pattern recommended. Plan path: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-26-corridor-character-generator/README.md`. Wire-up doc: `docs/vendor-notes/anthropic-web-search-wire-up.md`.

## 2026-05-26 (Sonnet 4.6 · main) — CCPM installed + corridor character generator epic wired to GitHub

- Installed CCPM (agentskills.io PM skill) into `.claude/skills/ccpm/` — gives any session a live `standup.sh` + GitHub Issues source of truth instead of relying on SESSION_LOG alone. Motivated by 4-5 parallel sessions with no shared state.
- Created corridor character generator epic in CCPM: `.claude/prds/corridor-character-generator.md` + `.claude/epics/corridor-character-generator/` with 5 task files (34.md–38.md). Synced to GitHub: epic #33, tasks #34–#38 (`ethanrickyjrjr-wq/brain-platform`).
- Step 1 (vendor verification) was already DONE by a prior Opus session — discovered from untracked `docs/vendor-notes/anthropic-web-search-wire-up.md`. Critical finding: **use `web_search_20250305`, NOT `web_search_20260209`** (dynamic filtering kills citations — 0 `cited_text` spans). Posted finding on GitHub epic #33 and closed issue #34.
- Step 2 parallel decomposition from wire-up doc posted to GitHub: Batch A (fact pack builder + SQL migration, parallel) → Batch B (corridor_grounded pipeline, `web_search_20250305`) → Batch C (synthesizer + lint stack).
- Next: any session picking up Step 2 should read `docs/vendor-notes/anthropic-web-search-wire-up.md` first, then `gh issue view 35` for acceptance criteria. Branch: `feat/corridor-character-generator-step-2`.

## 2026-05-26 (Opus 4.7 · main) — corridor character generator v2 plan propagation

- Locked v2 plan for replacing `corridor_profiles.character` (24–26 May-era Claude-drafted strings) with a two-block generator output: facts block (strict, sourced, lint-tight) + speculative block (AI unleashed with inline "Speculative — double-check" disclaimer). Optional chart block when comparison is useful. Sources chart page at the bottom of every answer carries citations + freshness token + legal/disclaimer (NOT in the answer body).
- Anthropic `web_search_20260209` locked as the grounded-search vendor. Decision rationale captured in `docs/vendor-notes/grounded-search-research-2026-05-26.md` from a 7-vendor background research run; per-claim citations with `cited_text` spans + raw publisher URLs + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` already wired. Three-vendor bake-off skipped — structural pick was clear.
- Propagation shipped in this commit: canonical plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-26-corridor-character-generator/README.md`; vendor research at `docs/vendor-notes/grounded-search-research-2026-05-26.md`; CLAUDE.md SWFL Protocol rule 8 carries an in-place carve-out exempting the speculative block from the smoothing-tokens ban; ontology-and-roadmap.md bumped to v1.6 with a new "Future-vision items (post-character-generator)" section (FL-other-cities comparison, statewide/national anchors, forecasts, outlier brain, BYO overlay, Tavily helper — all gated, none start before the generator ships one full cycle); memory `project_corridor-character-generator.md` indexed in MEMORY.md as a high-visibility ACTIVE PLAN pointer.
- Next: Step 1 — Anthropic web_search vendor-first check + smoke test against one corridor (Pine Ridge Rd Naples). Gated on operator availability. Plan path: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-26-corridor-character-generator/README.md`.

## 2026-05-26 (Opus 4.7 · main) — corridor character snapshot baseline

- Froze the live `corridor_profiles.character` strings into a committed baseline at `docs/audits/2026-05-26-corridor-character-snapshot.md` (26 corridors · 10 Collier · 16 Lee · 0 unknown-county · 0 pending broker narratives). Source: `refinery/tools/pull-corridor-character-snapshot.mts` (re-runnable; same-day re-runs are byte-identical). Renames an earlier audit-mode puller; strips the per-row decision-checkbox template — file is a data snapshot, not a worksheet. Reverted the `docs/audits/*-corridor-character-audit.md` gitignore rule. Added `npm run snapshot:corridor-character`. Carries along the parallel-session commit `20692fc` (bare-env fix) onto origin/main.
- Why now: the May-2026 Claude-drafted character strings are about to be replaced by a corridor-character generator (deterministic local data pack + Gemini grounded answer → cited prose). Need a diff baseline + restore safety before the live column gets rewritten.
- Next: vendor-first check on the Gemini grounding API (model ID, grounded-answer response shape, citation format) before scoping the generator pipeline. Do not start the generator until that check is in-session.

## 2026-05-26 (Opus 4.7 · main) — env names: BRAINS\_ no longer required

- Finished the 2026-05-25 env normalization. Code now reads canonical bare `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` first, with `BRAINS_SUPABASE_*` as legacy fallback (matches the `service-role.ts` pattern from PR #19/#30). Updated: `refinery/config/env.mts:76-82`, `refinery/lib/predictions-log.mts:97-104`, `refinery/lib/predictions-log.test.mts` (clears both pairs), `scripts/lake-probe.mts:8-10`. Stale doc comments fixed: `refinery/tools/embed-all-concepts.mts`, `refinery/packs/cre-swfl.mts`, `.claude/commands/vault.md`, `utils/supabase/service-role.ts`.
- Why this slipped: PR #19 normalized `.env.example` + the GHA cron wrappers but left the runtime code reading `BRAINS_`-prefixed only. Anyone running with a fresh `.env.local` (bare names only) hit "missing env" — Ricky just hit it via `npm run audit:corridor-character`. The legacy fallback stays per `docs/littlebird-notes/2026-05-26.md`: "Don't cleanup the fallback first" — Vercel still has the legacy names.
- Verified: `bun test refinery/lib/predictions-log.test.mts` 5/5 pass; `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` clean.
- Next: when Vercel env is renamed, one-line PR to delete the `??` legacy fallback in each of the 4 code sites.

## 2026-05-26 (Opus 4.7 · main) — cleanup pass

- Merged PR #32 (`acee6aa`) and PR #29 (`ca0a099`). main is at `ca0a099`. Zero open PRs.
- Resolved PR #29's SESSION_LOG.md conflict in the `brain-platform-permits` worktree by taking origin/main's version (which had the corrective Opus entry from PR #32) — no content was lost. Merge commit on the branch: `1a14e85`, squashed into `ca0a099` on merge.
- Cleaned up 4 stale remote branches (`feat/permits-swfl-v2`, `feat/firecrawl-pipelines`, `feat/firecrawl-pipelines-github-actions`, `fix/waitlist-resend-lazy-init`) — all confirmed merged via PRs #29/#17/#15/#16. Removed the permits worktree. Force-deleted 2 stale local branches (squash-merge orphans).
- Final remote: only `origin/main`. Final local: only `main`. Working tree: only the untracked `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-26-corridor-broker-narrative-promotion/` directory (operator's, not from any session).
- Next: operator refresh — `git pull` in any other sessions, point Sonnet at the worktree pattern (`git worktree add ../brain-platform-<branch> <branch>`) for the next parallel run.

## 2026-05-26 (Opus 4.7 · fix/redfin-dry-run)

- Restored the Opus race-condition entry below that the prior `9c514eb` commit dropped (append-only violation: Sonnet edited from a stale read of SESSION_LOG.md and rewrote my entry with an older version).
- No code changes; SESSION_LOG.md only. This is a corrective commit so the eventual merge to main does not silently delete the warning entry already on origin/main.
- Lesson for the next session: **before editing SESSION_LOG.md, `git pull` first and confirm you see every prior session's entry.** If your edit would remove any line of any prior `## YYYY-MM-DD (model · ...)` block, stop — you're working from a stale base.

## 2026-05-26 (Sonnet 4.6 · fix/redfin-dry-run)

- Added `--dry-run` to `ingest/duckdb_pipelines/redfin_swfl/pipeline.py` + `test_dry_run.py`.
- Last of the not-yet-running pipelines missing the flag; all 8 now covered.
- Next: merge PR #29 and this PR after CI green.

## 2026-05-26 (Sonnet 4.6 · feat/permits-swfl-v2)

- Rebased `feat/permits-swfl-v2` (651c102) onto main (c19d3ca); 1 commit, clean.
- Added `--dry-run` to `ingest/pipelines/lee_permits/pipeline.py` + test; 33/33 green.
- Updates PR #29 (already open); no new PR needed.
- Next: merge PR #29 after CI green; add `--dry-run` to `redfin_swfl` on separate branch.

## 2026-05-26 (Opus 4.7 · main)

- Shipped enforced session-log mechanism + commit/push autonomy rubric. Five files: `SESSION_LOG.md` (this), `CLAUDE.md` (RULE 0 + RULE 1 at top, behind `<!-- SESSION-LOG-RULE-MARKER -->`), `.claude/hooks/print-session-log.mjs` (SessionStart: prints last 8 entries + verifies marker), `.claude/hooks/check-session-log-on-push.mjs` (PreToolUse Bash: blocks `git push` when no commit ahead touched SESSION_LOG.md), `.claude/settings.json` (wired).
- RULE 1 authorizes Claude to commit + push small/policy/tooling changes without asking, and lists what still requires a diff review (brain pack math, ingest→data_lake, schema migrations, multi-file refactors, anything affecting live `/api/b/*` or MCP).
- Race condition discovered mid-build: a parallel Sonnet 4.6 session sharing this working tree picked up my untracked `SESSION_LOG.md`, committed it onto `feat/permits-swfl-v2`, and switched HEAD under me. Sonnet's own entry will arrive on `main` when PR #29 merges — expect a 30-second conflict on this file, resolve by keeping both entry blocks. **Operator action needed: use `git worktree add` for parallel Claude sessions, not the same working tree.**
- Memory: `project_session-log-mechanism.md` + high-visibility pointer at top of MEMORY.md.
- Pushing this commit now under RULE 1 authority.

## 2026-05-25 (prior session · main)

- Seed entry — see git log for c19d3ca (GHA unblock + brand scrub), 86435b8 (Lane D fully live), c3b9d0a (waitlist env-name fallback #30).
